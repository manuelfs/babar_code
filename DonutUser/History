    Moved the TMVA code out of DonutAnalysis.cc because it gave too many warnings
    in SL5, and was done in SmallNtuple.cc anyway.
    Added some mES calculations.

    Took candRejectedTracks/Photons out of the MVA
    Cleaned up some comments and unused smear
    Added candM2Tru and uncommented some other variables

    Added the 8 MVA that I intend to use, 2 per channel. Also added the
    possibility of selecting the best B using an MVA. Set doBestBEEx to false.
    canMES has now the mES correction, and candMES_orig is the original mES.
    Cleaned up all the warnings by initializing all variables, and deleting
    the ones that were not used.

    GNUmakefile:  Solved linking problem with DonutUserApp (below).  The
      problem was that "~manuelf/..." is not properly expanded by g++ for -I
      (include) options (though linker did accept it for the .so library).
      Using GMake's "$(wildcard ...)" function to do shell expansion works.
      Also moved TMVA library reference from LOADLIBES to SYSLIB, so it
      appears in correct link order.

    DonutAnalysis.cc:  Added CVS "Id" string at top.  Manuel needs to put in
      a proper comment header.  Also, his implementation of TMVA, with a
      local pointer created in ::event(), will not work.  The pointer, along
      with all of the "AddVariable" buffers, needs to be moved to class data
      members, and instantiated in ::beginJob().

    DonutAnalysis.cc/.hh have now code that makes use of a BDT trained with
    TMVA 3.9.6, but linking still seems to be against the TMVA in root 5.14,
    so it crashes at run time.

    DonutNtuple:  Copy Donut-specific tag bits (DonutMCTagger) to N-tuple.
    DonutWeightsAUB.cc:  New weights validation job adapted from GeneratorsQA.
    GNUmakefile:  Add new weights validation executable.
    *_DonutUser.mk:  Update dependencies for new weights validation.

    GNUmakefile:  Fix to locate private (Manuel's personal directory)
      version of TMVA library; only need -L directory, not library name.

    link_DonutUser.mk, bin_DonutUser.mk:  Update dependencies.

    TAG V00-00-00 for Analysis-50

    - Code to make ntuples used in the B->D(*)TauNu analysis
      It does not compile because it needs to link against an up-to-date TMVA library
