Hi Guglielmo and Bob

I have been working on the PID, so let me "lightly" address your comments
first, and I'll post as many thorough studies tonight as possible.

GUGLIELMO
===============================================
1. p*l cut
There are indeed some high bins for low p*l, although in the
nominal fit there are also low bins. For the loose BDT cut
the data is more consistently high, and could be due to
increased mis-ID.
I'll see if I can repeat the analysis cutting on pl (in the lab)
for tonight.

2. Off-peak for the continuum
We indeed use the Off-peak to set both the p*l shape and yield
of the continuum. The caveat is that we do it before cutting on the
BDT. After cutting, you have 1-10 off-peak events per channel.
The fit releasing both continuum and combinatorial was just to
show that no matter what yields we fix those components at,
the fit agreement is not going to improve much (unless we change
the PDFs).
We believe we know these components to 6-7%, and the control samples
(of which the off-peak does go down into the signal region)
and Dpi0 fits do not seem to indicate otherwise. 

3. mmiss issues near zero
Yes, when we subtract the the normalization the D*0 does not looks great.
I'm going to try to do a more systematic study of the 
resolution dependence, and see how much the results change.

4. Tightening the BDT
Agreed. Another configuration that I'll try to do by tonight.

5. Purity of the tag
Unfortunately, I don't have Rtc in the ntuples. I'll see if 
I can repeat the fit for low tag multiplicity, and there's better agreement

BOB
=========================================
With the loose BDT, we are basically doubling the events in the signal
region. That means that half of the events are overlapping (100%
correlation) and the other half is independent. I'm also not sure
what the correlation is, but it seems it would be of the order of 50%. 
Adding the difference as a systematic would add the statistical uncertainty,
of these new sample of events which is as big as the nominal sample.
It would seem to me unwarranted. 
If I have time to repeat the fit for more configurations, 
maybe we'll see the statistical fluctuation.
We could assign variations over 1 sigma.



Finally, I really appreciate all those insights. I feel the review
process is significantly helping the analysis. Whether we are
all satisfied by Friday, that is a different matter.

Regards
Manuel
